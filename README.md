# GitHub++

Adds keyboard shortcuts and other stuff to GitHub.

For easy discoverability, the extension amends GitHub's site-wide keyboard shortcut map (press "?" outside a text area) with the shortcuts it adds. Example section:

<img src="shortcuts.png" width=317 />

## Current Features

* Adds shortcuts to toggle between PR tabs and view diffs without whitespace.
* Adds a button to view diffs without whitespace for people that prefer that.

## Installation

1. Go to <chrome://extensions>
2. Check the "Developer mode" option in the upper right corner
3. Click *Load Unpacked Extension* and select this folder

### Why Isn't This in the Chrome Web Store?

It could be, I'm just lazy.

Also this is a developer tool, and it's easier to hack on if you install it locally.
When you make changes, you just have to Cmd-R reload <chrome://extensions>.
